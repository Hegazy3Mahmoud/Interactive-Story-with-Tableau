## Introduction

In this project, I created an interactive story using Tableau, showcasing Nintendo's video game sales data through a series of visualizations. The story provides insights into sales trends, platform performance, genre distribution, and top-selling games. Additionally, the project includes a competitor analysis comparing Nintendo with PlayStation and Xbox.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Area Chart**: Nintendo video game sales by release year.
2. **Sales by Platform**: Breakdown of sales for Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, and other platforms.
3. **Treemap**: Distribution of video game sales by genre.
4. **Top Sold Games**: Ranking of Nintendo’s top video games by sales.

## Dashboard Creation

The visualizations were combined into a comprehensive dashboard with interactive elements, including filters and legends, to allow for dynamic data exploration. The dashboard is designed to provide a seamless overview of Nintendo’s video game sales data.

## Story Creation

The dashboard visualizations were then combined with similar visualizations for PlayStation and Xbox to create a detailed story titled “Competitor Analysis 1994 - 2010”. This story highlights key insights and trends in the video game industry over the specified period.
